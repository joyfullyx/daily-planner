# Work Day Planner

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create a daily planner to input tasks in hour timblocks for the 9am - 5pm worker. 

The timeblocks are color coded so that if the time on the schedule has already passed the current time, the time block is gray. If the time block is within the same hour as the current time, the time block is red. If it is a time block that has not passed yet, the time block displays green. 

The application is used to store tasks or notes for a specific hour, and those notes can be accessed again after the user leaves and revisits the page due to the information being stored in local storage- given that the user saves their notes with the save button for each time block.

This application was made with compoments of: 

<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>Jquery</li>
<li>Fontawesome</li>
</ul>
